My name is Anand Jain. I'm an technical lead, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Indore, India, but I moved to Pune in 2018.
I love all foods, particularly Italian food, but strangely I'm love by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just love the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
