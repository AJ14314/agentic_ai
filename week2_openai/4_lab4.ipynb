       "\n",
       "**LangChain** is a prominent Python-based framework that enables developers to build custom large language model (LLM) applications. Its modular design supports integrations with various LLMs and external tools, facilitating the creation of complex workflows. Key features include native support for multiple LLMs, a rich ecosystem of tools like Google Search and SQL, and capabilities for memory and conversation tracking.

       "\n",
       "**AutoGen**, developed by Microsoft, focuses on multi-agent systems and code automation. It allows agents to communicate in natural language, coordinating tasks such as planning, development, and review. AutoGen includes built-in agents like AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent, and offers a graphical interface for prototyping and testing agents. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "**CrewAI** emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, enabling the creation of intelligent ecosystems where agents work together to achieve goals. It provides tools for defining roles, assigning tasks, and orchestrating processes, making it suitable for applications requiring coordinated agent efforts.

       "\n",
       "**LangGraph**, an extension of LangChain, introduces a graph-based approach to managing stateful AI workflows. It allows developers to define agent steps and logic as nodes and edges in a graph, supporting complex workflows with loops, conditional logic, and human intervention points.
