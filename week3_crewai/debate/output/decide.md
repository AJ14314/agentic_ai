The proponents of strict laws correctly identify the potential harms of LLMs, such as the spread of disinformation and biased outcomes. However, the arguments against strict regulation are more persuasive because they highlight the dangers of stifling innovation and creating unintended consequences through overly rigid legislation. The counter-arguments also offer a more flexible approach that focuses on addressing specific harms while allowing for continued development and innovation in the field.
