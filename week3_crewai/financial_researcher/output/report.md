Alright, so I need to create a comprehensive report on Tata Motors. Let me start by understanding the company's current status. I remember reading that Tata Motors is a major player in the automotive industry, especially in India, and they've been expanding globally. I should look into their latest financial reports to get an accurate picture of their revenue, profits, and any debt they might have. I think they've been focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) lately, so that's something to highlight.

Next, I need to delve into their historical performance. How has the company grown over the past five years? I should check their annual reports from 2020 to 2024 to see trends in revenue, net profit, and market share. It would be useful to include a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for revenue to show growth consistency.

Now, major challenges and opportunities. I know the automotive industry is facing supply chain issues and rising commodity prices, which could affect Tata Motors. They might also be dealing with regulatory changes, especially with the push towards EVs. On the flip side, their expansion into new markets and focus on EVs could be significant opportunities. I should mention any strategic partnerships or investments they've made recently.

Recent news and events are crucial. Have there been any new product launches, mergers, or significant partnerships in 2025? I recall hearing about the launch of the Tata Punch EV and some investments in battery manufacturing. Including these will show the company's current activities and strategic direction.

For the future outlook, I should discuss their plans for EVs, global expansion, and any technological innovations they're working on. It's important to mention their financial targets and how they plan to achieve them. Also, considering the market conditions, both globally and in India, will provide context for their growth prospects.

Finally, I need to ensure the report is well-structured with clear headings, includes all the key information, and is presented in a professional manner. I'll make sure to use specific data and figures to back up each section, providing a clear and engaging analysis.

Okay, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll gather all the necessary data and start drafting each section, ensuring I cover everything from financial health to future plans. I'll also include references to credible sources to support my findings.
