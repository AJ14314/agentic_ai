The chosen company is NPST. It was chosen due to its strong growth, transition to major exchanges, and expansion into new markets. While NPST exhibits volatility and a recent decline in net sales, its overall stellar performance in FY 2024, securing orders for innovative solutions, and expansion into new verticals and international markets outweigh these concerns.

NuSummit was not selected because, although it is a promising technology company specializing in AI, cloud, cybersecurity, and business modernization, and is backed by Investcorp, it is a private company, making direct investment not possible.
